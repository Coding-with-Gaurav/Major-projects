    "Laparoscopy: A surgical oncologist makes a few small incisions and inserts a laparoscope —a thin tube with a tiny camera attached to it—into one of the incisions to capture an interior image, while inserting surgical tools into the other incisions to excise malignancies and surrounding tissue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Laser surgery: The surgeon uses a narrow beam of high-intensity light to remove a tumor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cryosurgery: The surgeon uses liquid nitrogen to freeze and kill cancer cells.\n",

    "Robotic surgery: This surgery is similar to a laparoscopic surgery. However, instead of manipulating surgical tools by hand, the surgeon uses a computer console to operate the robotic tools.\n",

ASURE is intended to improve surgical outcomes and enhance the patient experience before, during and after surgery, while also reducing the length of a patient’s hospital stay.\n",

    "The program is delivered by City of Hope multidisciplinary teams, which include surgeons, anesthesiologists, nutritionists, behavioral health therapists, nurses and other clinicians. They work collaboratively to implement evidenced-informed protocols, all under one roof. ASURE combines post-surgical rehabilitation with pre-habilitation, by preparing patients before surgery.\n",

The use of enhanced recovery methods like those used in ASURE has been shown to reduce fatigue, post-surgery complications and the amount of narcotics used in post-surgical care, while helping patients resume their everyday activities more quickly.\n",

    "Well… that was an oversimplified — and slightly exaggerated for dramatic effect — reconstruction of my medical experiences visiting a doctor. But it drives the point home. Remember the mobile charger hell… it is like that, only the stakes are higher. \n",
    "Every healthcare service provider these days uses a technology platform to manage its services. This includes a Hospital management system (HMS), Electronic Health Record (EHR), Patient Record (PHR) system etc. In practical terms, health data interoperability means that healthcare information can be accessed by authorised providers across different systems, regardless of where the information was originally generated or stored. This includes data such as medical histories, lab results, imaging studies, Insurance coverage, and other clinical information.\n",
    "Apart from healthcare providers like a hospital or doctor’s clinics, The purview of Health Data Interoperability includes Diagnostic labs, Insurance providers, Pharmacies, Wellness Service providers (Gyms, Yoga centres), Mobile Health and Wellness (HnW) apps, Wearable devices (iPhone, Fitbit, Glucometer), Government Healthcare Schemes like CGHS etc, and even public health research. \n",
    "The lack of interoperability has been a major barrier to the adoption of health information technology and the sharing of patient data in the past. \n",
    "But before we dig deeper into that, we must Quench the Question that is Quintessential to the Quest for a change from the Quiescence. (Wow.. what a Quip.. right?)\n",
